CONTENT_DESCRIPTION = Javamancer is intended to allow exploration of the \
Neuromancer DOS PC game assets as well as emulate the engine that operated the game. \
I hope to bring the ability to play the original DOS game in this \
Java implementation.  This software is based upon the extensive reverse engineering \
work of Henadzi Matuts ( @HenadziMatuts on GitHub ). Handanzi created a 64-bit Windows \
version of the game called "Reuromancer" and released it in 2017 along with blog \
posts describing in detail how they achieved a better understanding of the \
Neuromancer game and it's data. It is my goal to build upon that work and port \
the knowledge and C code to a JavaFX version.
