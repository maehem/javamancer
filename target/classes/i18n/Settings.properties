STATUS_DAT_HOWTO_INSTRUCTIONS = The DAT resource files of the original Neuromancer DOS-PC \
game are required for this software to work. We do not provide them as they may \
be under copyright restrictions and it is assumed that most users have aquired them \
from the original game somewhere.\n\
Obtain the NEURO1.DAT and NEURO2.DAT files and place them in the DAT folder created \
by this program. The DAT folder is located in the users Documents folder or on Mac, \
in the users Library/Application Support/Javamancer/0/DAT folder. You may gain quick \
access to this folder by clicking the folder icon in the settings window. \n\
When the software detects the two files are present, a green check mark will appear. \
Should the files not be found, a red X or cross will appear.\n
