 * [3] ::             Its Showtime!  Welcome to the Regular Fellows.  Were a group of joeboys who consider themselves artists.  If you think youre an artist as far as cranking warez are concerned, youre a Regular fellow.  Just enter the password, "VISITOR". Have fun.
 * [4] ::    X. Exit To Main   1. BattleChess 2.0   2. Scout 1.0
 * [5] ::   3. Probe 3.0
 * [6] :: We try it before you buy it.       X. Exit To Main      1. Scout 1.0      2. BattleChess 2.0
 * [7] :: Scout 1.0, recon program Reviewed by Zelig Dorn  Floats like a butterfly and stings like a rail gun.  This little program is the answer to your wildest dreams.  Imagine youve just made contact with a new base. You want to know how many levels it has.  Are there secret levels? Enter Scout 1.0. Using Scout after linking into a base, and while still on the intro screen, gives you an accurate reading of how many levels the base contains.
 * [8] :: BattleChess 2.0 chess program extraordinaire reviewed by Matt Shaw  Okay, so forget I did the mod on this puppy.  Ill admit its true that I took a Panther Moderns ear and made a synthesilk purse out of it, but then  miracles just flow when these magic fingers do their work.  I doubled the depth of algorithms this warez handles, plus speeded it up and increased the history files it has to include even some of the games Morphy played near the end.  Now this binary chess wiz has responsive reciprocal mobility and total transitional capability.  Labor of love it was. Best of all, I left the initialization protocols all alone so the World Chess Confederation still thinks its BattleChess 1.0. Check it out.
 * [9] :: To: Raphael Spraycan From: Deathangels Shadow  Saw the work on the wall over by Crazy Edos.  Did he pay you for that or what?  Nice touch, the fish eggs on toast.  Really rad, you know!
 * [10] :: To: All From: Matt Shaw  World Chess Confederation (WORLDCHESS) is having another of their regular tournaments.  Ive uploaded my jacked up version of BattleChess 2.0.  Itll pass their screening and ought to blow away the ChiCom warez running against it.
 * [11] :: To: All From: Mo #243  Hey, guys, I need some help.  Im jacked in on my friends Ausgezeichnet 188 BJB.  My Yamamitsu UXB flamed out yesterday.  What should I do?
 * [12] :: To: Mo #243 From: Deathangels Shadow  Quit whining and get a real deck. That goes for your friend, too.  But dont come back here with messages asking us what to buy.  Were not Consumer Review.  Return only after you get a real box to put your warez in.
 * [13] :: To: All From: Harpo  Just found second level password for the Cheap Hotel; its "COCKROACH".
 * [14] :: To: Harpo From: Matt Shaw  Checked on the password for Asanos second level as you requested. Its "PANCAKE", but it seems to be encoded.
 * [15] :: To: Red Snake From: Scorpion  Red! Do you know the link codes for Fuji or Hosaka?
 * [16] :: To: Scorpion From: Red Snake  Why do you keep asking me about Japanese companies? Do I look like Julius Deane?
 * [17] :: To: All From: Deathangels Shadow  The ICE out there has gotten smarter. Each time you use the same ware against it, it does less damage. Always keep a variety of different warez with you.
