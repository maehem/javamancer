[4] ::              In the Know         an information service           of Bank of Berne.    The Bank of Bernes security chief, Roger Stefano, is dead.  "Roger died in a terrorist strike against one of our bank branches.  The attackers, members of the National Liberation Front for the Canary Islands, were intent upon kidnapping April Heurse, the daughter of the Canary Islands leading industrialist.  Roger stopped two bullets meant for her, and April, drawing a fully automatic mini-uzi from her purse, killed the three attackers.    We deeply regret Rogers loss, but we would like to point out that all of our customers can expect this sort of dedication from our people.    Bank Gemeinschaft has denied rumors that money has been chiseled from some of its accounts.  Cyberspace Cowboys, according to some wild reports, are able to syphon funds from accounts, but Bank of Bernes new security specialist, Horatio Ariel, says, "That couldnt happen here.  Things are too tightly controlled at the Bank of Berne."
[5] :: To: Tozoku Imports From: Anson Auric    We are inquiring about a shipment for Mr. STEFAN ROGERS.  We understand it might arrive in pieces, and we have no difficulty in accepting it this way.  How soon will it be delivered?  We have, as you will recall, paid in advance for this shipment, and our client is very concerned over it.  We hope it has not disappeared.  Sincerely, Anson Auric
[6] :: To: Anson Auric From: Tozuku Imports Re: Rogers shipment    Not lost, merely hiding.  We are closing in on it and expect delivery soonest.  We will notify you when things are under control.
[7] :: To: Anson Auric From: Thomas Cole  Anson,   Thank you for being so frank about your losses.  We have an excellent security man, Roger Kaliban, who could be of service to you, if you need him.  I appreciate your sharing your information with me.  We shall be on the look-out for any strangeness that occurs in our accounts.
[8] :: To:  Anson Auric From: Administration    Due to the security problems weve been having, weve changed the master authorization code for the Funds Transfer system to LYMA1211MARZ.  The Funds Reserve Account number is still 121519831200.  Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
[9] ::
[10] :: To: Gold From: Greystoke    Yes, yes, the cyberscum must be stopped from raping the banks.  You are right to bring this to our attention.  Do what you must to stop them.
[11] :: To: Gold From: Neuromancer    Gold, I believe you should not take offense at the pilfering of rounding errors.  We all know you keep track of them down to the hundredth digit.  That these cowboys place a value on that sort of thing does not make you any less powerful.  If they attack you, by all means, defend yourself, but we should not take the offensive, no matter what Greystoke predicts.
