[3] :: Our Romcards Never Forget
[4] :: Company News   ***3rd Quarter profits are up!  Thanks to the effort of each and every one of  you, our employees, weve increased productivity.  This drives our costs down and jacks our profits ever higher.  With the demand for quality products out there as insatiable as it is, were going to be on top of the world.  Management has increased meat puppet breaks from 10 to 11.5 minutes for all line employees just to show you they care.  ***R and Ds Esther Radklif and Andy Raymond have finally gotten married. They had planned a skiing honeymoon in the Alps, but Andy would have had to have sold both legs to afford it, so they decided to forego that pleasure. Theyll just remain here in Chiba City and cozy up their nest a bit.  I know we all wish them well.  ***New Hires:  Mishiji, Takoda  Security OBrien, Akira   Management Kharkov, Sven    Line production Bors, Melissa    Employee Services Wang, P. Ryan    Acquisitions Bear, M. C.      Legal Moe, Larry       Consultant
[5] :: Executive Survival Kit Welcome. We have two rules around here: 1) Mr. Watkins is always right. 2) see rule #1  Follow the rules and well get along fine.  Remember to cover your ass with paper, but never stray far from a paper shredder and youll have a long career with Fuji Electric. Welcome aboard -- dont rock the boat. (signed) Harry Watkins
[6] :: ***For Immediate Release NASA and FUJI ELECTRIC DO BUSINESS  In anticipation of next centurys manned shot at Alpha Centuri, NASA signed a multi-trillion dollar contract with Fuji Electric to provide ROMcards and software development for the Prometheus ship. Fuji Spokesman Harry Watkins said, "This is the smartest move NASA has made since the dawn of their program." Fuji anticipates unparalleled growth over the next decade.  "Well have new employees coming on every day.  If not for our own computer system, wed have no way to keep track of them. Technology has made the human race great, and we want to lead the pack," said Watkins.  For further information contact Watkins at FUJI or Bob Shepherd at VOYAGER.  (Just want you to know, my fellow employees, this contract was awarded on the strength of your work. Thanks, Harry...)
[7] :: To: Management Level Employees From: Harry Watkins RE: TOZOKU merger  It is true that TOZOKU has made us an offer we have accepted concerning the ownership of FUJI.  The days of a dynastic company have ended and I gladly consider turning control over to the people of TOZOKU.  I know some of you think of them as common criminals, but I can assure you there is nothing common about them at all. I thank all of you who were concerned about my wife and child.  Theyve been returned to me and weve found all of little Harrys parts.  The doctors say hes got an excellent chance of recovery and I agree that he doesnt really look like the Frankenstein monster at all.  Harry
