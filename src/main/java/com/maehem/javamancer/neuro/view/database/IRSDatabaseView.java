 * [4] :: IRS Field Supervisors:  Field Supervisors should warn IRS Field Examiners under their command that use of the garrote, the Rack, and the Iron Maiden by Examiners is unwarranted under most Taxpayer Compliance Program cases.  The rubber hose and the insertion of bamboo under the fingernails should be sufficient for Taxpayer compliance in most situations where motivation is required.  Use of stronger forms of interrogation by Field Examiners is frowned upon, unless a Field Supervisor qualified in Interrogation is present, or the Field Examiner is performing a Special Field Audit.
 * [5] :: Due to the high number of Taxpayer requests for current information, possibly due to the Publics inability to remain current with the hourly changes in the Tax Code, the IRS Administration has approved the activation of a question-and-answer bulletin board service on this system. The real purpose of this service is locate and arrest tax offenders who have otherwise managed to be overlooked by our standard procedures. So far, results have been excellent. In two weeks of operation, over four thousand tax offenders have been arrested and sentenced.

 * [8] :: Date: 11/16/58 To:   L. Zone  Your business is an illegal operation. We have identified you to the proper law enforcement agencies.  Pending further investigation, your total income for the year has been turned over to us.
 * [9] :: Date: 11/16/58 From: Rafaella Hammer BAMA ID: 2776081129  Due to an oversight on the part of my accountant, I failed to report all of my income for the last year.  What form should I file to correct this oversight and how much of a penalty will I have to pay?
 * [10] :: Date: 11/16/58 To:   Rafaella Hammer  We have given your case careful consideration and have decided that there will be no penalty incurred on the income you failed to report last year.  However, you and your tax accountant are going to jail.
 * [11] ::     Field Audit List
 * [12] :: No report at this time.
 * [13] :: Name:  BAMA ID: 0563061187  Summary: The accused tax offender listed here is scheduled for a Special Field Audit as soon as our IRS Special Forces unit or one of the other police agencies is able to locate the accused. The tax offender named above has mysteriously acquired a lump sum, either illegally obtained or received as some sort of payment for services. Proper forms have not been filed to explain this unusually large sum. Investigation has revealed that one of the orbital Swiss banks has recently "lost" certain cash reserves which are similar in total value to the lump sum acquired by the accused tax offender. Following standard field audit procedure, the field examiner for this case will be allowed to carry large-caliber hand guns as well as chemical and biological weapons.  The accused is to be considered armed and dangerous, so authorization is hereby given to terminate the accused at the slightest provocation or untoward movement.  If necessary for field audit purposes, the field examiner may call in an IRS Special Forces unit.
