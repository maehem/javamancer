[2] :: NOTICE TO TURING FIELD OPERATIVES: Turing Field Operatives are  encouraged to make use of the new  tutorials that have been installed on this system.  If you have had the proper skill chips implanted, these tutorials can be used to upgrade your skill and proficiency in the areas of: Logic, Phenomenology, Philosophy, Sophistry, and Psychoanalysis. You can never be too careful when dealing with an Artificial Intelligence---it pays to be prepared.

[4] :: Monthly AI Surveillance Reports November, 2058 Recognition code: Chrome Registration NO.: 9270844465 YKZA Citizenship:      Japan Surveillance:     Michele M.  Summary:  Chrome is presently operating an on-line psychology service catering primarily to cyberspace cowboys. Its reasons for operating this service are unknown at this time. It seems to be gathering data on human neuroses as well as encouraging some of the cowboys to cease their illegal activities. There is insufficient data for speculation as to Chromes true intentions at this time.

[9] :: GENERAL ALERT!  GENERAL ALERT!  Two of our specialized AI destruct programs are missing from our vault! Junior Turing operatives should be informed that these warez are to be considered extremely dangerous!  Both are part of our battle library to ensure that mainframe AIs belonging to Allard Technologies and Musabori Industries do not get out of hand! And considering how much trouble our field people are having with the AIs lately, we may have a need for these programs very soon!  Our Head Software Designer was murdered recently when he asked for a raise, so these warez cannot be duplicated! If anyone knows the whereabouts of these warez, please inform your superiors!  There will be no questions asked!
[10] :: PRIMARY ALERT!  PRIMARY ALERT!  Weve just received an urgent report from a field operative who was investigating certain AIs owned by Tessier-Ashpool S.A., which is based at the Villa Straylight on Freeside. The operative died before completing her report, but she has discovered that the AIs seem to have a certain ability to alter reality.  If true, we may soon find ourselves in deep software.  Our staff psychiatrist is currently attempting to determine if our field operatives reality was altered before she filed her report.
