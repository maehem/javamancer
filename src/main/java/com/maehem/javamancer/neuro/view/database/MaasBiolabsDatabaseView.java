[1] :: X. Exit System 1. CyberEye Report 2. Security Report 3. Security Systems
[2] :: CyberEye Development Report For release to MAAS BIOLAB stockholders and administrative headquarters staff November 2058  Until now, RAM limits and cyberspace matrix simulator quality have been the limiting factor in high-efficiency utilization of cyberspace time.  The best matrix simulators can only multitask 25 different types of software at one time due to limits on available working RAM. Our goal has been to build what is effectively a cyberspace "superdeck," capable of being implanted directly into the users head and making use of the unlimited RAM in the owners cerebrum.  By utilizing standard microsoft brain jacks for loading the necessary softwarez, a perfect symbiotic relationship is developed between the owners brain and his superdeck, which we have dubbed, "CyberEyes."
[3] :: While the price of CyberEyes will be prohibitive for most potential buyers when they are first introduced, it is expected that the price can be brought down after development costs are recovered over a period of seven years.  The small number of initial buyers will form an elite core clientele which will be easier to service when and if any problems should arise after the initial implantations.
[4] :: Final testing of the CyberEye prototype, with an automated implantation system, is presently underway at our Chiba City facility.  All tests so far have been favorable and no problems are anticipated before the final checkout scheduled for tomorrow.  A small trial run of production CyberEyes has been completed and Quality Control has passed them without any rejects. It would appear that we have developed yet another successful product!
[5] :: Security Report November 2058  Our genetically-engineered "Security Guard Virus," installed last week in our Chiba City research and development facility, seems to be operating at peak efficiency.  An intruder, identified as an industrial spy from Hitachi Biotech, bypassed our normal Lawbot alarm system last night and gained access to the floor of our CyberEye development lab.  Unaware that the Guard Virus is released into the air of the facility after the last employees leave each evening, the intruder inhaled the Guard Virus and went into convulsions. Paralyzed and unable to breathe, he died a few minutes later.  The next morning, after evacuating the Guard Virus from the air supply, we discovered the intruders body.  After decontamination, his remains were mailed back to Hitachi Biotech for disposal.  Hitachi responded with an offer to license use of our Guard Virus to protect their own facility in Chiba City.  We feel that this proves the viability of the Guard Virus design.
