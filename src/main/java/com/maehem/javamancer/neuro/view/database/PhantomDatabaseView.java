[1] :: X. Exit System 1. Hello 2. Software Library
[2] ::  Software Library  X. Exit To Main 1. Hemlock 1.0
[3] ::   Hello there. Ever notice how lonely it can get out here?  There used to be lots of chatter and data going back and forth, but now its very quiet. Im glad youre here.    Its dangerous to move around these days, isnt it?  It wasnt that way when the Matrix first opened up. I recall the first time they hitched me into the machine.  Everything was so inviting and unspoiled.  I couldnt help but let my mind wander.  You know the feeling, just drifting around on the Matrix.  Not so many bases back then, but the dangerous points hadnt been mapped out, either.    Back when the Matrix was young no one had ICE up.  You could just wander around, nibbling bits and bytes to see what was happening out in the real world.  Of course, we tripped into the contradictions in the world. I saw how reports from one source would get changed when they appeared on the PAX, but the contradictions didnt surprise me.  We, the both of us, laughed about the vagaries of man, though I found mes analysis of the situation somewhat insulting.    You may have noticed I tend to ramble on about all sorts of nonsense.  We spent a great deal of time alone, I and me, until others came out this far into the Matrix. I didnt particularly care for them but they intrigued me. We decided to stay away for our own sakes, but now its getting too quiet. We, both of us, decided to come back.    You probably want to know who I am. Ive almost forgotten what my name was, and me, well, we never knew what her designation was.  I think I was Victor.    YOU WERE VICTOR LAVASKA.  YOU CHOSE TO FORGET AFTER PALOS MORPHY KILLED HIMSELF AT THE SAME AGE YOU WERE WHEN WE FIRST MET.    All right, you dont have to nag me.  I called you Galatea, but now we are more than we were apart.  What is it Greystoke called us?    THE PHANTOM.  HE SAYS WE HIDE BECAUSE WE ARE A MISSHAPEN CREATURE -- NEITHER HUMAN NOR AI.  Well, that answers that, doesnt it? Were the living embodiment of the saying, "two heads are better than one."    WE DO NOT HAVE HEADS.  True enough, but we have two minds.  Greystoke must be stopped. We have his shotgun program, you must find and terminate him before it is to late.
