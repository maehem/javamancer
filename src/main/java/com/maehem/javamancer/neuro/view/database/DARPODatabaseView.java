[5] :: DARPO 44-15.8 Transfer alignment techniques for hypersonic weapon applications  Description:  For hypervelocity aircraft, the alignment transfer from the aircrafts internal navigation systems (INS) to the weapons INS differ in the excitation requirements levied upon the aircraft to create weapon internal navigation unit (INU) measurement observability. Hypersonic endoatmospheric flight (Mach 5-20) addresses issues which are not necessarily key drivers for supersonic weapons initialization.  This on-going research is investigating current hypersonic weapon delivery systems and INU alignment requirements.
[6] :: DARPO  21-99.2 Photon echo memories  Description:  The quantum mechanical interaction of laser light with electronic states in certain cryogenically cooled crystals can lead to the phenomenon of the photon echo, in which re-emission of the photon occurs after a known delay time. Theory indicates that the delay can be long (compatible with RAM refresh modes in matrix simulators). Computation indicates high-order storage capacity and access times in the sub-picosecond range.  Applications involve high performance matrix simulator imaging systems and possible upgrades to existing Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics systems.
[7] :: DARPO 44-12 Kinetic energy weapons  Description:  Development is proceeding along the lines of DARPO 16-54.7.  The systems being modified for higher performance include electromagnetic rail guns, plasma guns, and other hypervelocity projectile weapons, as well as chemically-propelled interceptors. Included in the kinetic energy weapons area are smart projectiles, homing devices, launcher design, engagement tactics, hypervelocity aerocontrol/thermal protection, and countermeasures.
