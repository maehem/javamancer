 * [2] :: 6. View Surveillance List
 * [3] :: SEA FIELD SUPERVISORS:  Field Supervisors should take note of the new matrix simulator protection softwarez that have just been made available on this system.  It will be the responsibility of the Field Supervisors to disseminate copies of these warez to their qualified cyberspace operatives. Due to the high number of requests for current information, the Administrative Bureau has approved the activation of a question-and-answer bulletin board service on this system.  Proper use of this service should increase the speed of response for Field Supervisor information-gathering purposes.
 * [4] :: SEA FIELD AGENTS:  Field Agents who would like to improve their interrogation and conversational abilities would be well advised to make use of the COPTALK tutorial.  Fourth level CopTalk ability is required for Senior Field Agent status.  While this tutorial has been available to download for the last eight months, our records show that usage has been light.  Lets see more ambition out there!

 * [7] :: Date: 11/16/58 From: Gibson, W.  One of my field agents, working undercover as a cyberspace cowboy known as "MR. DOS," seems to have vanished.  He was on the trail of some microsoft design thieves in cyberspace when I last heard from him.  Now hes been missing for two weeks.  Has he been reassigned to a deep cover on another operation?  Is he on loan to the Turing people?  And why wasnt I informed that he was off my team?
 * [8] :: Date: 11/16/58 To:   GIBSON, W.  With regard to your missing field agent, operating as "MR. DOS," we have no idea where he is.  He has not been reassigned elsewhere.  Maybe you misplaced him?
 * [9] :: Date: 11/16/58 From: GIBSON, W.  Regarding my field agent, "MR. DOS," I respectfully request an explanation as to how you think I could have misplaced him.  This isnt a piece of software were talking about.  MR. DOS is a human field agent.
 * [10] :: Date: 11/16/58 To:   GIBSON, W.  Solve your own problems.  Thats what we hired you for in the first place.
